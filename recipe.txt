1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper.
2. Slowly pour in the cold beer and whisk until a smooth batter forms. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes.
3. In the meantime, heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350째F (175째C). Preheat your oven to 200째F (95째C) to keep the cooked fish and chips warm.
4. Pat dry the fish fillets with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Cut them into desired portion sizes.
5. In batches, dip the fish fillets into the batter, ensuring they are coated evenly. Allow any excess batter to drip off before carefully placing them into the hot oil.
6. Fry the fish fillets for about 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oil and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Place the cooked fillets in the preheated oven to keep them warm while frying the remaining batches.
7. Meanwhile, fry the potato fries in the same hot oil for about 4-5 minutes or until golden and crispy. Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt.
8. Serve the fish and chips hot with malt vinegar and tartar sauce on the side. Enjoy!

Note: Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the fish fillets and the size of the potato fries. Adjust frying time accordingly to ensure they are cooked through and crispy.
